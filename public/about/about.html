                    <h2>Zuri</h2>
                    <p>Hi, Im Zuri! Im obsessed with fashion, art, my dog Lula, 
                        and my cat too. I spend my spare time growing my collection
                         of vintage dresses, playing the Sims 4, and customising
                          Blythe dolls. I think that its so important to make fashion 
                          accessible and fun while also being kind to the environment
                           - which is why Grace and I started Doll Planet! Every piece 
                           in Doll Planet has a story, and I cant wait for you to make
                            them a part of yours.</p>
